# AzureResume #CloudGuruChallenge
Very late to this challenge and very new to Azure in general. Though, I did give it a go nonetheless. 
https://youtu.be/ieYrBWmkfno as a guide to assist me with certain aspects (namely the Azure Function).

## Front-end
- Static site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
main.js contains a function triggered on DOMContentLoaded then fetches data via API call to an Azure Function.

## Back-end
- HTTP triggered Azure Function with Cosmos DB input and output binding. 

## Conclusion
Although I managed to get everything operational and understood most of the concepts, I felt it would be improper to use the C# Azure Function. My understanding of Azure functions still has some way to go. Once able to code this section myself in my programming language of choice (Python), I'll feel much more comfortable displaying the counter as my own.
